# Hamachi Setup for Fantasy Fight

## Your Network Details
- **Network Name**: fantasyfight
- **Password**: fantasyfight123
- **Status**: âœ… Network Created

## Next Steps

### 1. Get Your Hamachi IP Address
1. Open Hamachi
2. Look at your computer in the network list
3. Note the IP address (should look like `25.0.0.x` or `5.x.x.x`)
4. **Tell me this IP address so I can update the configuration**

### 2. Update Network Configuration
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Your Hamachi IP has been configured:
```python
HAMACHI_HOST = '25.54.132.81'  # Your Hamachi IP address
CONNECTION_MODE = 'hamachi'     # Set to use Hamachi
```

### 3. Start the Lobby Server
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
python lobby_server.py
```

You should see:
```
Starting Fantasy Fight Lobby Server...
Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

### 4. Share with Your Friend
Tell your friend to:
1. Install Hamachi
2. Join network "fantasyfight" with password "fantasyfight123"
3. Get their Hamachi IP
4. Update their `network_config.py` with your Hamachi IP
5. Start the game and join your lobby

## Testing the Connection

### For You (Host):
1. Start the lobby server
2. Start the game
3. Select "Play with Others" â†’ "Create Lobby"
4. Enter your name
5. You'll get a 4-digit lobby code
6. Share this code with your friend

### For Your Friend (Guest):
1. Join the Hamachi network
2. Start the game
3. Select "Play with Others" â†’ "Join Lobby"
4. Enter the lobby code you gave them
5. Enter their name
6. Both players should connect successfully

## Troubleshooting

### If Connection Fails:
1. **Check Hamachi**: Make sure both computers are in the same network
2. **Check IP Address**: Verify the Hamachi IP is correct in `network_config.py`
3. **Check Firewall**: Allow Hamachi through Windows Firewall
4. **Restart Services**: Restart Hamachi and the lobby server

### Common Issues:
- **"Failed to connect"**: Check if lobby server is running
- **"Lobby not found"**: Verify the 4-digit code is correct
- **High latency**: Normal for VPN connections, but turn-based gameplay should still work fine

## Quick Configuration Switch

To switch between local and Hamachi play:
1. Edit `network_config.py`
2. Change `CONNECTION_MODE = 'local'` to `CONNECTION_MODE = 'hamachi'`
3. Make sure `HAMACHI_HOST` has your correct Hamachi IP
