## Troubleshooting

### General Issues
- If images do not show in the graphical game, check the file paths in `main.py` and ensure your images are in `pygame_game/assets/`
- If you see errors about missing modules, make sure you installed pygame and pillow:
  ```sh
  pip install pygame pillow
  ```
- For animated GIFs, ensure the Pillow library is installed for proper frame extraction
- If resolution changes don't apply, try restarting the game
- For performance issues, try lowering the resolution or FPS in the settings menu

### Multiplayer Issues
- **"Failed to connect to server"**: Make sure the lobby server is running (`python lobby_server.py`)
- **"Lobby not found"**: Check the 4-digit code is correct
- **Connection timeouts**: Check firewall settings and port forwarding
- **Can't join from different network**: Configure port forwarding on router (port 5555)
- **Server crashes**: Delete `__pycache__` folders and restart server
- **Character selection stuck**: Check if both players are connected and try refreshing

### Network Setup for Internet Play
1. Find your public IP address (whatismyipaddress.com)
2. Configure port forwarding on your router (port 5555)
3. Update client connection settings with your public IP
4. Ensure firewall allows connections on port 5555
